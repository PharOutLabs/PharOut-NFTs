# PharOut-NFTs
Pharout NFT and TempMint solidity contracts for the bootstrap phase.

The Pharout market contracts allow for the minting of PharOut/Pham NFTs in exchange for an ERC20 set by the controlling DAO(initially set to $PHUNKY).
In order to help bootstrap the first development phase to mainnet launch of the marketplace contracts, a temporary mint contract was created to accept eth. The "TempMint" contract is currently held by a 2/3 Gnosis multisig for the Devs.
